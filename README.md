# VolatileOracle: Ephemeral Data Aggregation and Validation

VolatileOracle is a Rust-based tool designed for the secure and efficient aggregation and validation of ephemeral data sources. It provides a robust framework for collecting, verifying, and disseminating data that is inherently time-sensitive and potentially unreliable. This tool caters to scenarios where real-time, validated data streams are crucial, but the underlying data sources are prone to intermittent availability or are of questionable trustworthiness. VolatileOracle aims to bridge the gap between these dynamic data landscapes and the need for dependable, validated information.

The core purpose of VolatileOracle is to facilitate the creation of a trusted data feed from potentially untrusted sources. This is achieved through a combination of configurable data acquisition modules, sophisticated validation algorithms, and a consensus mechanism that ensures data integrity. Instead of directly trusting individual data sources, VolatileOracle leverages redundancy and statistical analysis to identify and mitigate inaccuracies or malicious data injections. The platform is designed for adaptability, allowing developers to easily integrate new data sources and customize validation rules to meet the specific requirements of their applications.

VolatileOracle is particularly well-suited for applications in fields such as IoT sensor data monitoring, decentralized finance (DeFi) oracles, and real-time market analysis. In these scenarios, the ability to rapidly and reliably access validated data is paramount. The tool provides a foundation for building resilient systems that can withstand data disruptions and maintain data accuracy even in adversarial environments. By providing a framework for handling volatile data, VolatileOracle empowers developers to build more robust and reliable applications that are less susceptible to data-related failures.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Data Acquisition:** VolatileOracle supports a modular architecture that allows for the integration of various data sources through customizable acquisition modules. Each module can be configured to fetch data from different APIs, files, or streams.
*   **Configurable Validation Rules:** The platform includes a flexible rule engine that enables developers to define custom validation rules for each data source. These rules can include range checks, consistency checks, statistical outlier detection, and more.
*   **Consensus Mechanism:** VolatileOracle implements a consensus mechanism that combines data from multiple sources and applies validation rules to arrive at a validated data point. This helps to mitigate the impact of individual data source failures or inaccuracies.
*   **Data Aggregation:** It efficiently aggregates data from various sources into a unified stream, providing a consistent and reliable view of the underlying information. The aggregation process is configurable to handle different data formats and update frequencies.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** VolatileOracle provides real-time monitoring capabilities, allowing users to track the status of data sources, validation rules, and the overall health of the system.
*   **Secure Data Handling:** The platform includes features for secure data handling, such as encryption of sensitive data and authentication mechanisms to protect against unauthorized access.
*   **Rust-based Performance:** Built with Rust, VolatileOracle offers excellent performance and memory safety, ensuring reliable operation even under heavy load.

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The core programming language providing performance, safety, and concurrency.
*   **Tokio:** An asynchronous runtime for building highly concurrent applications.
*   **Serde:** A framework for serializing and deserializing data structures efficiently.
*   **Reqwest:** An asynchronous HTTP client for fetching data from external APIs.
*   **Actix-web:** A lightweight web framework for building APIs and services.

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can download them from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2.  Clone the VolatileOracle repository:
    git clone https://github.com/uhsr/VolatileOracle.git

3.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd VolatileOracle

4.  Build the project using Cargo:
    cargo build --release

5.  The executable will be located in the `target/release` directory.

## Configuration

VolatileOracle can be configured using environment variables. These variables control various aspects of the platform, such as data source URLs, API keys, and validation rule parameters.

*   `DATA_SOURCE_URL_1`: The URL of the first data source.
*   `DATA_SOURCE_URL_2`: The URL of the second data source.
*   `API_KEY_1`: The API key for accessing the first data source.
*   `VALIDATION_THRESHOLD`: The threshold for the consensus mechanism. This value determines how much variance is acceptable between data sources before a data point is flagged as potentially invalid.

Example:

DATA_SOURCE_URL_1="https://api.example.com/data1"
DATA_SOURCE_URL_2="https://api.example.com/data2"
API_KEY_1="your_api_key"
VALIDATION_THRESHOLD="0.05"

These variables should be set before running the executable. You can set them directly in your shell or create a `.env` file in the project directory and load it using a tool like `dotenv`.

## Usage

To run VolatileOracle, execute the compiled binary:

./target/release/volatileoracle

The application will start fetching data from the configured data sources, applying the validation rules, and aggregating the data into a unified stream. The validated data stream will be output to the console by default.

You can also access the validated data through the API endpoint exposed by Actix-web. The default endpoint is `/data`, which returns the latest validated data point in JSON format.

Example:

curl http://localhost:8080/data

This will return a JSON response containing the validated data, such as:

{"value": 123.45, "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"}

The Actix-web service and data stream processing intervals can also be configured via environment variables.
